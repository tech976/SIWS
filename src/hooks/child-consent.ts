/**
 * FR-SW-03 / FR-PRV-11 — "content without a recorded consent shall not be
 * publishable", and the platform "shall block publication where no consent is
 * recorded".
 *
 * The check runs on the transition into `published` only. Saving a draft that
 * uses a photograph still awaiting its permission record is deliberately
 * allowed: staff need to be able to build the page while the office chases the
 * paperwork. What they cannot do is put it in front of the public.
 *
 * It also blocks re-publishing a page whose photograph has since been withdrawn
 * (FR-SW-05), which is the case that matters most in practice — a parent asks
 * for a picture to come down, and the page must not quietly restore it on the
 * next unrelated edit.
