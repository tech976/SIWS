 * FR-ADM-05 / FR-SUB-09 / FR-PF-07 — spam protection for public forms.
 *
 * The SRS suggests a CAPTCHA. This deliberately does not use Google reCAPTCHA
 * or hCaptcha, because those are themselves third-party trackers: FR-PRV-02
 * forbids any non-essential third-party script executing before consent, so a
 * reCAPTCHA-protected form would be unusable until a visitor accepted cookies —
 * and 2.5 additionally rules out behavioural tracking on a site used by
 * children. Three self-hosted layers are used instead:
 *
 *  1. A honeypot field, hidden from people but present in the DOM.
 *  2. A signed timestamp, so the server knows how long the form was on screen.
 *     Bots submit in milliseconds; a parent takes far longer.
 *  3. A per-address rate limit.
 *
 * Together these stop the automated submissions schools actually receive,
 * without sending a single visitor's data to a third party. If SIWS later
 * requires a formal CAPTCHA, a privacy-respecting one (e.g. a self-hosted
 * proof-of-work challenge) can be added as a fourth layer without changing the
 * call sites.
